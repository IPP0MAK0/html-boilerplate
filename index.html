    <h1> !!!The road to becoming a programmer!!! </h1>
  
    <p> 
       HI! name's <b>N8</b> This is by far not much than what i've done from the past, this is simply me mastering 
        the basics and allowing myself to <i>THRIVE</i> in an eniroment where I can creatively do projects.

    </p>

    <H2>This is smaller than the one above due to being H2 </H2>

    <p>This is a <strong>STRONGLINE</strong></p> 
    <p> This one makes it <em>ITALLIC</em></p>

    <!-- THIS IS ALL BASIC STUFF, BUT IS VERY VITAL TO MASTER, DO NOT MEMORIZE, UNDERSTAND AND COMPREHEND.
         EVETUALLY MUSCLE MEMORY WILL SIT IN, AND YOU WILL BECOME THE PROGRAMMER YOU ASTONISH TO BE!    -->
